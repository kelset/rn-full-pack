# Changelog

All notable changes to the "rn-full-pack" extension pack will be documented in this file.

---

## 1.1.0

Removing some packages that are not needed anymore - see [this blogpost](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/10-visual-studio-code-extensions-you-dont-need-6f7904132a57) for more details.

## 1.0.0

Moving this extension package to 1.0.
It was probably way overdue, but I decided to take a few moments to compare the list VS what I've been using for the past few years and I decided to give it a pass and clean off some packages that are deprecated/not needed anymore and add a few new ones.

- Added Markdown All in One, Kotlin and Polacode
- Removed Bracket Pair Colorizer, Setting Syncs (VSCode has both out of the box now)
- Removed ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets since I don't feel it's useful anymore

## 0.5.0/0.6.0/0.7.0
